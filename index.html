		<h2>Executive Director, <a href="https://codeforscience.org">Code for Science & Society</a></h2>

		<h2>Experience & Education</h2>
		<p>Before joining CS&S, I ran open source software and open research project management workshops around the world, explored decentralized approaches to data preservation, and advocated for open access to research as a 2016-2017 <a href="https://foundation.mozilla.org/fellowships/">Mozilla Fellow for Science</a>. Before Mozilla, I was a bench researcher in cell biology and neuroscience for nine years, completing a PhD in Neuroscience at Oregon Health & Science University in 2016. During my PhD training, I received a National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship and developed a quantitative imaging approach to explore the role of pseudophosphatases in a subtype of Charcot Marie Tooth peripheral neuropathy. Throughout my research career, I found myself increasingly interested in how the influence of funders, publishers, and other forces impact how research is conducted and communicated. This interest spurred engagement with the global <a href="https://www.opencon2018.org/">OpenCon</a> and <a href="https://www.science.mozilla.org/">Mozilla Science</a> communities helped me to build advocacy and community engagement skills. On my campus, I also led student advocacy efforts, including the passage of OHSU's <a href="https://www.ohsu.edu/xd/education/schools/school-of-medicine/academic-programs/graduate-studies/upload/2013-03-15-Academic-adjustment-for-new-parentsFINAL.pdf">PhD student parental leave policy</a> and developed programs to grow the local open research community, including <a href="http://openinsightpdx.com/">Open Insight PDX</a>, <a href="https://biodata-club.github.io/">BioData Club</a>, and <a href="http://portland.sciencehackday.com/">Science Hack Day PDX</a>.

			<h2>Résumé</h2>
			<p> Speaking, workshops, and other events are kept reasonably up to date as part of an overly comprehensive résumé <a href="https://github.com/daniellecrobinson/Danielle-C-Robinson-Website/blob/master/Danielle_Robinson_resume.md">here</a>. It's been a little quiet since the 2020, but I'm ok with that. 

<h2>Contact</h2>
<p>You can find me on <a href="https://twitter.com/daniellecrobins">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://github.com/daniellecrobinson">GitHub</a>, and of course <a href= "https://www.linkedin.com/in/danielle-robinson-phd-694996b5/">LinkedIn</a>. Responsiveness on these platforms is not guaranteed.
